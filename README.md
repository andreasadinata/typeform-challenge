# Typeform Challenge
* The app is built by HTML5, JS, CSS, and ReactJS.
* Will add Enzyme test for each components and TravisCI
* Typeform branding questionnaire the main source of the design
* The app is responsive where it can be easily accessed by mobile phone, tablet, and computer.
* Still in developmental process. Going to make more components to make it easier to read.
* Reason why I chose react over redux is because using redux will take up so much memory, even though it is so much easier to create it.
* Will change a few designs in the future
* Let me know if you guys have any questions
